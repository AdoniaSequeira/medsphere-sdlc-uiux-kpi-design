 # 🩺 MedSphere: Medical Appointment Scheduling System  
*Software Engineering Case Study*

A comprehensive software engineering case study that simulates the design of a medical appointment scheduling system. Covers the full SDLC cycle—requirements gathering, UI/UX wireframes, KPIs, UML modeling, test planning, and system architecture. Built as part of the M.S. Computer Science program at GWU.

## 🔍 Scope & Objective

MedSphere addresses inefficiencies in healthcare appointment systems by conceptualizing a user-friendly scheduling platform connecting patients with healthcare providers based on availability, specialization, and proximity.

This case study followed a complete SDLC flow:

- ✅ Functional & Non-Functional Requirements Gathering  
- 📈 KPI Definition for Tracking App Effectiveness  
- 🧩 Wireframing & User Flow Mapping  
- 🧱 System Architecture Design (ER Diagrams, DFDs, UML)  
- 🧪 Software Testing Strategy & Test Plan  
- 🌀 Agile Sprint Planning

## 📊 KPIs & Success Metrics (Theoretical)

| **KPI**                   | **Description**                                                     |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 📅 Appointment Success Rate | % of appointment requests completed successfully                   |
| ⏱️ Avg. Booking Time       | Time taken to complete booking (goal: under 3 minutes)             |
| 🧭 Navigation Depth        | Clicks needed to complete booking (goal: ≤ 3)                      |
| 🐞 Defect Density          | Bugs per module during testing (target: < 0.5 bugs/module)         |
| 💡 Feature Request Volume  | Unique enhancement suggestions from mock users                     |
